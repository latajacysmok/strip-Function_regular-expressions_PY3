# strip-Function_regular-expressions_PY3
A function strip.py that fetches a text string and executes the same sentence as the method named strip (). 
If the function is not passed on to other arguments than the text string to be processed, 
then whitespace should be removed from its beginning and end. 
Otherwise, the characters passed in the second function call are to be removed from the text string.
